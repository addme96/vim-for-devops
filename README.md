# awesome vimrc

I have started this awesome project to sync my minimal `.vimrc` file into GitHub. Initially, writing Python code was only in focus. But now I am using vim as a generalized lightweight editor at my day-to-day DevOps works. I am using it for Bash/Python/Golang programming and writing Dockerfiles, Ansible Playbooks, Terraform Codes.

# Usage

Let me suppose that you have installed all dependencies already.

## Install

### MacOSX

Please, open a terminal and play this command to install the latest vim.

```bash
$ brew install vim
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/vim -y
```
```bash

```

## Set up

Play these commands on Terminal to set up Vim.

```

```

## Shortcuts

The **Leader key** is a way of extending the power of VIM's shortcuts by using sequences of keys to perform a command. The default leader key is **comma**.

| Key | Description |
